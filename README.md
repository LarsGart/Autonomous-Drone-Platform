# Autonomous Drone Platform (ADP-1.0)

_This project is version 1.0 of an ongoing collaboration between [Lars Gartenberg](https://github.com/larsgart) and [Jerin Abraham](https://github.com/jerinabr)._

The goal of ADP is to construct an autonomous quadcopter from scratch, capable of simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM), collision avoidance, and object detection.

# Hardware/ Software Specifications
List sensors, camera, motors, battery, frame specifications, etc.

All computation is done on-board with the Nvidia Jetson Nano (2GB).

Frame data is captured using the M12 Lens Camera for Raspberry Pi and is preprocessed through Python's OpenCV library.
