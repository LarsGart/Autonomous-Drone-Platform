      - Uses Zed._get_state_space_representation() to read angles and angular velocities.
      - Linearized small-angle model: angle_ddot = torque / I_axis.
      - State for controller: [angle, ang_vel] per axis stacked -> 6 states.
      - Input: torques for roll, pitch, yaw (3 inputs).
      - Motor mapping is the same as in your old Controller (4 motors).

      - Torque -> motor speed conversions require tuning.
